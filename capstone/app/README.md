# Race Schedules API

This API is submitted as my *student's choice* implementation to satisfy the requirements of the Capstone for the Udacity [Full Stack nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd0044).

## About the API

The API is written in Flask in Python. Code and instructions for interaction with the API can be found in the [backend](./backend) directory. The [frontend](./frontend) was not required for this Capstone project and remains a work in progress.

## Motivation

In my free time away from work, I enjoy wheelchair racing. I have raced competitively since I was about 9 years old (almost 30 years!), including about 70 marathons and countless shorter races. I have also raced internationally, representing the USA at high-profile events.

I have long wished for a better way to share information about my past and upcoming races as well perhaps provide a bit of a social network to do the same for my peers. There just aren't many good options out there for sharing the information I want in the way I want.

This API is a first step toward possibly realizing that dream, and allowed me the opportunity to play with some of the ideas (and, oh yeah, this will be a lot harder to do than I imagined).
